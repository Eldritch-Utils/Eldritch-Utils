# Eldritch-Utils

> *"Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate"*

Welcome to **Eldritch-Utils**, an open-source collective of arcane security tools and cursed developer utilities. Inspired by the unknowable, built for the practical.

We build small, modular, and self-hostable tools for:
- **Authentication** (Yog-Sothoth: The Gate)
- **Encryption** (Yog-Sothoth: The Key)
- **Monitoring & Integrity** (Yog-Sothoth: The Guardian)
- ...and more to come.

## Our Philosophy
Simplicity. Transparency. Power wrapped in madness.
Every project is designed to be:
- **Minimal** – No bloated dependencies.
- **Secure** – Best practices built-in.
- **Understandable** – Even to mortals.

## Projects
| Module | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **The Gate** | Lightweight auth server (JWT, roles) | MVP in progress |
| **The Key** | CLI encryption/decryption (AES-256) | In development |
| **The Guardian** | Log and file integrity watcher | In planning |

## Contribution
All are welcome to open issues, summon pull requests, or propose new rituals. See each module's README for more info.

## License
MIT. We may be eldritch, but we're permissive.
